System Identification And Mounting script

This script can automatically be called to mount the supported devices as rw or ro. As many devices use different memory block partitions, this script aims to overcome that.

Many thanks to Ghost1227 who originally created this script. I have added devices and modified the script to be called whilst the phone is on, to assit with other scripts I have created.
Without Ghost1227 I would be nowhere. I know he spent hours on this script and I am truly grateful.

If your device is unlisted, please submit a pull request (or email luke at iinga dot net) with the following information:
getprop ro.product.device
mount | grep system | cut -d ' ' -f 1
